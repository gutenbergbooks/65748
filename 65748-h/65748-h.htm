</div>


<p>A great many years ago, when I was quite a
small child, I was taken with some other children
over Westminster Abbey by Dean Stanley,
who was then the Dean of Westminster.</p>

<p>Some of you may have read a book called
“Tom Brown’s School Days,” and if so you
will remember Tom’s great friend, Arthur, who
began his school life a lonely and home-sick
little boy, but who as the years went on came
to be looked up to and liked almost more than
any other boy at Rugby. “George Arthur” this
boy is called in the book, but his real name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
was Arthur Stanley, and when he grew up he
became a clergyman, and was for many years
Dean of Westminster. He wrote a great many
books, and one all about Westminster Abbey;
for he knew every corner and part of this
great church, and was full of stories about the
great people who are buried here, and the
kings and queens who were crowned here.
There was nothing he liked better than taking
people over the Abbey, and any one who had
the happiness of going with him, as I did, and
of hearing him, would always remember some,
at any rate, of the stories he told.</p>

<p>He died in 1881, and as none of you can
ever see or hear him, standing in the Abbey
surrounded by children, and telling them all
that he thought would interest them, I am
going to take out of my memory, and out of
this book of his,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> just as much of what he used
to say as I hope will help you to enjoy what
you will see there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>When one goes to visit any place for the
first time, there is always a great deal that
one wants to have explained; and what I
myself most enjoy is to read or be told beforehand
something about what I am going to see,
and then I understand it much better&mdash;I do
not waste so much time in asking questions,
and have all the more time to look about.</p>

<p>If we go and stand at the great West Door,
as it is called, of Westminster Abbey, and look
down Victoria Street, it is difficult to believe
that this very same place was, hundreds of years
ago, quite wild country. Where there are now
houses and streets and churches, there used to
be only marshy land and forests. Where there
are now endless streams of carriages, carts, and
omnibuses, and people hurrying along, there
were in the far-off time, when the Abbey
Church of Westminster was first begun, only
wild oxen or huge red deer with towering
antlers which strayed from the neighbouring
hills and roamed about in this jungle. It used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to be called “the terrible place,” so wild and so
lonely was it.</p>

<p>Dotted about in the marsh were many little
islands, one of which was called Thorney Isle,
because there were so many wild thorn trees
growing there, and on this spot Westminster
Abbey now stands.</p>

<p>For as the forests in this part of London
were gradually cut down, this island looked
so pretty and quiet with the water flowing all
round it, and nothing to be seen from it but
sunny green meadows, that King Edward the
Confessor chose it as the place to build a great
church, which he called the Church of St. Peter.
At that time there were not many large churches
in England, and the Church of St. Peter was
thought to be one of the most splendid that was
ever seen. It took fifteen years to build, but
at last it was finished, and on Christmas Day,
1065, King Edward the Confessor, wearing his
crown, as was the custom in those days on
great occasions, came with all his bishops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
nobles to the first great service in the Abbey
Church which he himself had built. He was
then a very old man, and a few days after the
great service he was taken ill and died, and
was buried in his own church. He is called the
Founder of the Abbey, and you will see, when
you go round it, the shrine of King Edward
and of his queen, who was afterwards buried
at his side.</p>

<p>Now, there is only one more thing to be
remembered before we begin to look round inside
and decide what are the most interesting things
to see, and that is that this Abbey we are in
to-day is <i>not</i> the actual Church of St. Peter
which King Edward the Confessor built. Of
that church there is now left only a little bit
of one pillar, which perhaps a guide will show
you, within the altar-rail, in what is called the
“Sacrarium.” I do not mean that the church
was pulled down all at once, and this Abbey
built instead, but bit by bit, as years went
on, it was added to and altered. New parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
were built on by different kings&mdash;for Westminster
Abbey is a church that has been all built
by kings and princes&mdash;and as the new parts
were added, the old were gradually pulled down.</p>

<p>Of all the kings who helped to build and
beautify the Abbey, Henry III. was the one
who did most, and he spent on it such
enormous sums of money that he is often
spoken of as one of the most extravagant kings
England ever had. He made up his mind that
the Abbey of Westminster was to be the most
beautiful church in the world, and he used to
invite the best foreign artists and sculptors
to come and help to make plans and paintings
and carvings for it. He it was who built the
shrine where Edward the Confessor is now
buried, in the part of the choir behind where
the communion table (formerly the high altar)
now stands. It was when he was growing to be
an old man that he thought the founder of the
Abbey ought to be treated with special honour
and respect, and so almost the last thing he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
in his life was to build this shrine, which stands in
what is called Edward the Confessor’s Chapel.</p>

<p>The king sent all the way to Rome&mdash;and in
those days the journey was a very much longer
and more difficult one than it is now&mdash;for the
mosaics and enamels which are still to be seen
on the shrine; the workmen who made it came
from Rome, where the best workmen were then
to be found; and the twisted columns round the
shrine were made in imitation of the columns on
some of the tombs in the great churches in
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>When it was finished, in 1269, the old king
himself, his brother Richard, and his two sons,
Edward and Edmund, carried the coffin of
Edward the Confessor on their shoulders from
the place where it had been buried in 1065 to
the new chapel, and there it has rested to this
very day.</p>

<p>Years afterwards a great and magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
chapel was added by Henry VII. at the east
end of the Abbey, which was called after him.
He was buried there when he died, and so were
his grandson, Edward VI., and Queen Elizabeth,
and Mary Queen of Scots, and many others
whose tombs you must look at by-and-by.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1509 that Henry VII.
was buried in Westminster Abbey, just four
hundred and forty-four years after the burial
of King Edward the Confessor. But in these
four hundred and forty-four years the Abbey
had been so much altered, the old parts so
pulled down and rebuilt, that King Edward,
could he have seen it again, would hardly
have believed that this great Abbey, as we see
it to-day, had grown up from his first Church
of St. Peter on Thorney Isle.</p>

<p>And now, as I have said enough about the
building of the Abbey, we can go inside and
begin to see some of the monuments and tombs
of which it is full.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>This chapter on the <i>geography</i> of the Abbey, as
I call it, has nothing to do with the stories
which begin in the next chapter, and the only
reason that I have written it at all is this.
In the days when I first heard many of the
stories which I am going to tell you now, they
were told to us by Dean Stanley in the Abbey.
As we walked about with him he explained
to us what part of the church we were in, and
pointed out the tomb or monument of the man,
or woman, or child about whom he was telling
us. But some of you may read this little book
before you have ever been to Westminster
Abbey, and others may have been there, but
may not know the names of the different parts
of the church, or where any particular monument
or tomb is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>So, instead of trying to explain at the beginning
of every story whereabouts we are supposed
to be standing, I am putting all such
explanations in this chapter; and this will, I
hope, help you to find your way about in the
Abbey for yourselves. If you only want to
hear the stories, you must miss this chapter
and go on to the next one.</p>

<p>Just as we have maps to understand the
geography of countries, so we have maps, which
are called <i>plans</i>, to understand the geography
of churches and houses, and the drawing you
see on the opposite page is a map or plan of
the inside of Westminster Abbey. The picture
at the beginning of this book is a view of
the outside.</p>

<p>We will now suppose we have just come into
the Abbey at the great west door, the door
between the two towers (see frontispiece). The
name is marked on the plan.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
then be standing in what is called the nave,
and right in front of us and through those
iron gates underneath the organ is the choir.
That is where service is held every morning
and every afternoon, and where all the
Westminster School boys sit on Sundays when
they come to church, for as Westminster
school has no chapel of its own, the boys
have all their services in the Abbey. Through
the choir gates you can see the communion
table in front of you, and behind that, again,
are all the chapels where the kings and queens
are buried. The nave and transepts are full
of the monuments and graves of great men.
The numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., on the plan mark
those about which you will find stories
later on.</p>

<p>And now, if you look at the plan, you
will see exactly where everything is. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
whole Abbey is built on a piece of land which
has the shape of a cross laid upon the ground.
The nave and choir represent the stem of the
cross, and the two transepts form the two
arms.</p>

<p>In the part of the choir beyond the communion
table are the chapels. Altogether there are
eleven, and they are arranged like a wreath
round the shrine of Edward the Confessor.
They are marked on the plan by the letters
A, B, C, etc., and their names you will find on
the plan, beginning with A, which is the Chapel
of Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>One last thing I must explain before we begin
the stories, and that is&mdash;how this great church
came to be called an Abbey, and not a Cathedral.
It is not at all difficult to remember when you
have once been told.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Peter did not stand, as
you may have supposed, all by itself on Thorney
Isle, but was only one part of a mass of buildings
called the Monastery of St. Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>A monastery, as you very likely already
know, was a kind of college for monks. Here
they lived under the rule of an abbot; and the
church belonging to the monastery&mdash;for every
monastery had a church, as well as a school
and hospital or infirmary, belonging to it&mdash;was
called an Abbey.</p>

<p>In early days the life of the monks was a
very busy one. They did all the rough work,
such as cooking, and cleaning pots and pans; for
although many of them had been great soldiers
or great nobles, they did not think any work
done for the monastery was beneath them. They
ploughed the land and planted seeds; they cut
down trees for firewood; they nursed the sick;
they fed and looked after the poor who lived
round about them; and they taught in the
school, and watched over the boys who were
sent there to be educated.</p>

<p>Many boys&mdash;not only those who intended to
become monks when they grew up, but those
also who were to go out into the world, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
become soldiers&mdash;went to the monastery schools
to be taught. Here the sons of great nobles
sat to learn their lessons side by side with the
children of the poorest people, who were allowed
to come and have as good an education as the
rich without paying any school fees. The
schools were open to all who wished to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, Scripture was the chief thing that
they were taught, but the monks did not think
that alone was enough, and the boys often
learnt, besides reading and writing, grammar,
poetry, astronomy, and arithmetic. Latin many
of the monks talked almost as easily as their
own language, and very often music and painting
were added to all this. In the cloisters,
or covered walks belonging to the monastery,
the boys learned their lessons, always with a
master near by, and sitting one behind another,
so that no signals or jokes were possible. And
very hard it must have been to keep their
attention on their work in summer time when,
if they looked up, they could see through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
open archways the sun shining on the grass
in the centre of the cloisters, and inviting them
to come and play there. Something was always
going on in the cloisters. Sometimes the schoolboys
were tempted to waste their time watching
the monks shaving. Once a fortnight in
summer, and once in three weeks in winter,
the monks came out here with hot water and
soap, and the important business of shaving
went on, while on “Saturdays the heads and
feet of the brethren were duly washed.” If
while all these things were going on the abbot
appeared, every one stood up and bowed, and
the lessons and the shaving and the washing
stopped until he had passed by.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important part of every
monastery was the library, and an abbot who
cared much for the monastery over which he
ruled tried to collect and preserve and buy as
many books as he could. In those days printing
was not invented, and so every book of
which many copies were wanted had to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
written out by the monks. And this they did
in a most wonderful way, copying them, so
we are told,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “on parchment of extreme fineness
prepared by their own hands,” and ornamenting
them with “the most delicate miniatures and
paintings.” The monks at that time loved their
books more than anything else, and there was
a saying among them that a cloister without
books was like a fortress without an arsenal.
Often they took long and difficult journeys to
see or to copy the books in other monasteries.
“Our books,” said a monk, “are our delight
and our wealth in time of peace, ... our food
when we are hungry, and our medicine when we
are sick.”</p>

<p>And now, having told you a little about the life
of the monks in those far-off days, we must come
back to these buildings on Thorney Isle, which
as I have said were called the Monastery of St.
Peter. It is not known when this particular
monastery was first founded; but it is said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
St. Dunstan, who lived in the reign of King
Edwy, found there some half-ruined buildings.
He repaired them, and then brought twelve
monks to live in company with him. But
probably the Danes, who were often invading
England at that time, destroyed this little monastery,
for when Edward the Confessor came
to the throne, many years afterwards, it had
almost, if not quite, disappeared; and when he
rebuilt it he added this great church of St. Peter,
about which I told you in the first chapter.</p>

<p>There is a pretty story told of how this came
about. An old monk was one day lying asleep,
and in his sleep he was commanded by St.
Peter, who appeared visibly to him, to acquaint
the king that it was his pleasure he should
restore the monastery. “There is,” said the
apostle, “a place of mine in the west part of
London which I choose and love. The name
of the place is Thorney.... There let the king
by my command make a dwelling of monks,
stately build and amply endow; it shall be no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
less than the House of God, and the Gates of
Heaven.” When he woke up, the old monk
went to the king and told him his vision.
Upon hearing it Edward journeyed to “the
west part of London;” there he found Thorney
Isle, and there he built the monastery and church,
which he called after the apostle.</p>

<p>And now at last we have finished all the
explanations. In the first chapter I told you
how the Abbey came to be built, and in this
one I have shown you how to find your way
about it. In the next I shall begin telling
you the stories, the first being about Lord
Shaftesbury, whose monument is in the nave,
where you see No. 1 on the plan.</p>

<p>Very likely you have never even heard the
name of Lord Shaftesbury; but as you will be
sure to read and hear of him by-and-by, I will
tell you a little about what he did, and why
a monument was put up in his memory. He
was born in 1801, and died in 1885, and so was
an old man of eighty-four when he died. He
spent all his long life in trying to make other
people&mdash;especially the poorest and most miserable
he could find&mdash;more happy and more comfortable.
He was a great nobleman, and very
rich, and he gave most of his time to finding
out the cause of the suffering of the poorest
people in England, and, when he had found it
out, he helped to make laws to improve things
for them, and, if money was wanted, he gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
that too. But he gave away his money wisely
and well; he never was taken in by idle
people and beggars who would not work for
themselves; his motto seems to have been to
“help those who help themselves,” and one
name by which he was known was “The
Working Man’s Friend.” But especially may
he be remembered by all children for what he
did for children. More than fifty years ago,
when first machines (spinning machines and
weaving machines) were invented in the great
cotton factories in England, it was found that
children could work them just as well as men
and women; and as children would not have
to be paid so much as men, the masters of
the mills began to employ them. Quite tiny
children, sometimes not more than five years
old, and so small that they often had to be
lifted up on stools to reach their work, were
made to toil in the mills and factories all
day, and sometimes all night too. They were
treated like little slaves. If they did not work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
fast enough, they were beaten and kicked by
their masters; and they spent all their days
in hot rooms, hearing nothing but the whirring
of the machines, and stopping their work only
for about half an hour in the middle of the
day for their dinner, which was generally only
black bread and porridge, and sometimes a little
bacon. They had no time for play, and they
had no time to rest, except on Sundays, and
then they were too tired to move from the
berths (or shelves) where they slept, for they
did not even have proper beds.</p>

<p>Then, again, there were the children who
worked in coal-mines, who spent all their days
in damp, dark mines, who never saw the sun,
and who had to draw the trucks filled with coal,
or carry great baskets full of it on their backs.
And all this they began to do before they were
six years old.</p>

<p>When Lord Shaftesbury saw these things&mdash;for
he went into the mills and the factories,
and he went down into the mines&mdash;he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
up his mind that something must be done
for such children. So he made speeches in
Parliament, in which he told of the cruelty
with which thousands of English children were
treated; and at last laws were made by which
it was forbidden to let such little children work
in mines and factories at all, and by which older
children were given shorter hours to work and
more time for rest and fresh air. All this
and much more Lord Shaftesbury did during
his long life, and when at last he died, this
monument was put up in Westminster Abbey
with these words on it, so that people who had
never known him might be always reminded of
the way he spent his life:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LORD SHAFTESBURY,<br />
BORN 1801; DIED 1885.<br />
ENDEARED TO HIS COUNTRYMEN BY A LONG<br />
LIFE SPENT IN THE CAUSE OF THE<br />
HELPLESS AND SUFFERING.<br />
“LOVE&mdash;SERVE.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Close to Lord Shaftesbury, there is a monument
to a great soldier, General Gordon,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who
was killed in Egypt in 1885&mdash;the same year
that Lord Shaftesbury died. He fought in
the Crimean War and in China, and was often
called “Chinese Gordon.” All the soldiers who
served under him were so fond and proud of him
that they would have done anything for him.
He was very brave, and it was well known
that he would always be in the front rank to
lead his men when there was a battle, and this,
more than anything else, made him popular. He
himself never was armed except with a little
cane, which his soldiers called “the wand of
victory.” Once when he was wounded his men
wanted to carry him out of the battle, but
he would not allow it, and went on leading
them till he fainted from pain and weakness.</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury, the great statesman, died
in England, with all his many friends near
him, and General Gordon, the great soldier, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
killed by savages while he was shut up in
Khartoum, a town in Africa, where he was
besieged; but their two monuments are close
together in Westminster Abbey, and they were
alike in one thing&mdash;they both did all they could
to help other people. Of course, Gordon had not
time to do so much as Lord Shaftesbury,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but
when he was not fighting he lived in England,
and then “his house,” said a gentleman who
knew him,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “was school and hospital and almshouse
in turn. The poor, the sick, and the
unfortunate were all welcome. He always
took a great delight in children, but especially
in boys employed on the river or the sea.
Many he rescued from the gutter, cleansed them
and clothed them, and kept them for weeks in
his house. For their benefit he established
reading classes. He called them his kings, and
for many of them he got berths on board ship.
One day a friend asked him why there were so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
many pins stuck into the map of the world
over his mantelpiece. He was told they marked
and followed the course of the boys on their
voyages; that they were moved from point to
point as his youngsters advanced, and that he
prayed for them as they went night and day.
The light in which he was held by those lads
was shown by inscriptions in chalk on the fences.
A favourite one was ‘God bless the Kernel,’”
which was their way of spelling “colonel,”
for he was at that time Colonel Gordon.</p>

<p>But I must not stay to tell you more of him
now, for there are many other people I want
you to hear about. “This Abbey,” Dean
Stanley used to say, “is full of the remembrances
of great men and famous women. But it is also
full of the remembrances of little boys and girls
whose death shot a pang through the hearts of
those who loved them, and who wished that
they should never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>So now, not far from the monuments to these
two great men, we come upon the tombs of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
boys who are buried here: one Edward Mansell,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
a boy of fourteen, who died as long ago as 1681;
and another Edward, Edward de Carteret,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a
little boy “seven yeares and nine months old,”
who “dyed the 30th day of October, 1677.” His
father and mother put nothing on his tomb to
tell us about him except that he was a “gentleman;”
but that one word tells us much, for it
means, said Dean Stanley, that “they believed&mdash;and
no belief can be so welcome to any father
or mother&mdash;they believed that their little son
was growing up truthful, manly, courageous,
courteous, unselfish, and religious.” And if this
little boy had tried to be a “gentleman” in
this true and best sense of the word, it does not
seem out of place that he should be buried in the
Abbey among great men and famous women.</p>

<p>Close by little Edward de Carteret is buried
Sir Isaac Newton.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There is on the floor a
plain grey stone with these few words in Latin
on it, “Hic depositum quod mortale fuit Isaaci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Newtoni,” which means, “Here lies what was
mortal of Isaac Newton.” Sir Isaac Newton
was one of the most celebrated Englishmen
who ever lived, and made wonderful discoveries
in science, especially in astronomy, by which
his name is known all over the world. He was
born on Christmas Day, 1642, and lived to be
seventy-five years old. In spite of being so
learned and so famous, he was always modest
about what he knew, and believed that what
he had learned and discovered was only a very,
very little bit of all there was to learn and
discover in the world and about the world.
When he was quite an old man, some one was
saying to him one day how much he had done
and how wonderful his discoveries were, and he
answered, “To myself I seem to have been as a
child picking up shells on the seashore, while the
great ocean of truth lay unexplored before me.”</p>

<p>Just above the grey stone in the floor there
is a large statue of Sir Isaac Newton, sitting
with his head resting on his hands as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
he were thinking, and a great pile of books by
his side.</p>

<p>I have already told you about General Gordon.
I now come to the story of another great soldier,
Sir James Outram, who is buried in the Abbey.
The graves of Sir James Outram and of David
Livingstone, a great traveller and missionary,
and of Lord Lawrence, who was the Governor-General
of India, and who did a great deal for
the natives while he lived among them, are all
close together, and there is something interesting
to tell you about all these three men, especially
Sir James Outram and David Livingstone.</p>

<p>If you have read or heard anything of the
story of the Indian Mutiny, when the native
soldiers of India rebelled against the English
who governed them, and killed hundreds of
men, women, and children, you must, I think,
have heard the names of Lord Lawrence and
Sir James Outram.</p>

<p>During the years he had lived among them,
the natives of India had grown so fond of Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Lawrence,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that when the mutiny (or rebellion)
broke out, the men of the Punjaub (which was
the part of India he then governed) said they
would be true to the man who had been good
to them, and so they fought for England with
the few English soldiers who were then in India,
and helped us to conquer the rebels. Lord
Lawrence has been called the “Saviour of India,”
because he came to the help of his fellow-countrymen
with these Indian soldiers just when
he was most terribly needed.</p>

<p>Later on, in the same war, came the siege of
Lucknow. Lucknow was one of the chief cities
of India, but the streets were long and narrow
and dirty, and most of the houses were poor
and mean. Among them, however, were some
magnificent palaces and temples. The Residency,
the house where the English governor of Lucknow
lived, was built on a hill above the river,
and all round it were the offices and the
bungalows of the English who were living there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
When the mutiny broke out, it was soon seen
that the native soldiers would attack the English
in Lucknow, and the people at once set to work
to make as many preparations against them as
they could. To begin with, Sir Henry Lawrence,
who was in command of the soldiers
both English and Indian, and who was the
brother of Lord Lawrence, of whom we spoke
just now, ordered all the women and children
to come and live in the Residency, which was
supposed to be the safest place in Lucknow.
Then guns, powder and shot, and food were
brought in and stored in the cellars. At last, at
nine o’clock on the evening of the 30th of May,
1857, when the officers were quietly at dinner,
nearly all the native soldiers in Lucknow suddenly
rose against the English. They loaded
their guns, and fired at every one they could see;
they broke into the houses, and, after stealing
everything they could, set fire to them; and all
night there was nothing to be heard save the
savage yells of the rebels and the firing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
guns, and nothing to be seen but fighting men
and burning houses. About five hundred of the
native soldiers were true to the English, and
they stayed with them and fought against
their rebellious countrymen through all the long
siege of Lucknow. For though the rebels were
beaten at their first rising by the English, yet
in a month or two they rose again, and then
every one, including the soldiers, was driven
by the enemy into the Residency, which was
the last place of refuge.</p>

<p>Some day, perhaps, you will read a poem
by Lord Tennyson called “Lucknow,” which
describes all the terrible things that happened
during the “eighty-seven” days the English
and the faithful natives were shut up in the
Residency, on the topmost roof of which, as
he says, the “banner of England blew” during
the whole siege, though it was shot through by
bullets, and torn and tattered, and faded in the
hot Indian summer sun.</p>

<p>One of the first things that happened was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
that Sir Henry Lawrence was killed. He was
lying on his bed one morning talking to an
officer, when a shell was fired from a cannon into
his room. It burst as it fell, and some of its
fragments wounded Sir Henry so terribly that
he died the next day. Almost the last thing he
said to the other officers was to beg them never
to give in to the natives, but to fight as long
as there was an English man left alive. Lord
Lawrence, his brother, who died some years
afterwards, was buried, as you remember, in
Westminster Abbey; but Sir Henry Lawrence
was carried out of the Residency while the
fighting was going on, and the bullets were
falling like rain, and buried side by side with
some private soldiers who had also been killed
by the rebels. On his gravestone they put these
words, which he himself had asked should be
written there, “Here lies Henry Lawrence, who
tried to do his duty.”</p>

<p>This was on the 4th of July, and Sir Henry
Lawrence had said he thought it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
possible to defend the Residency for a fortnight.
But as time went on the English grew fewer
and fewer; every day more soldiers were killed,
and every day many died of their wounds, while
those who were left alive had to fight day and
night. The English ladies nursed the sick men,
and cooked the food, which they used to bring
out to those who were fighting; and they looked
after the children, very many of whom died too.
For it was the hottest time of the year in India&mdash;a
time when English children are sent away
to the hills to get fresh air&mdash;and, besides suffering
from the heat, they missed all the comforts
they were accustomed to; they had no milk and
very little to eat, and they were terrified by the
noise of the firing and all the confusion.</p>

<p>But still the fighting went on day after day,
long after the fortnight was over, and day after
day the enemy saw the English flag still flying
on the roof of the Residency, and began to
think they never would conquer this brave
little band of Englishmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>All this time, however, though they did not
know it in the Residency, Sir James Outram<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and Sir Henry Havelock, with more English
soldiers, were fighting their way to Lucknow.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>They had both been for many years in India,
and were two of the bravest and best men who
could possibly have been sent to the relief of
the little band who had been besieged for so
many weeks. On the 23rd of September, nearly
<i>twelve weeks</i> after the day Sir Henry Lawrence
died, it was heard in Lucknow that Sir James
Outram and Sir Henry Havelock were close
by, and on the 25th the Highlanders were in
the city and fighting their way through the
narrow streets to the Residency. Then from
every window and every balcony and every roof
the rebels fired down on them. Many were
killed and more were wounded. A story is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
told, by Mr. Archibald Forbes,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of two Irishmen
who were in the Highland regiment.
“They were great friends, named Glandell and
M‘Donough, and in going through one of these
narrow streets M‘Donough’s leg was broken by
a bullet. He fell, but he was not left to die, for
his friend who was by him took him on his
back and trudged on with his heavy burden.
Although he was carrying M‘Donough, Glandell
determined to fight at the same time, so when
there was a chance to fire a shot, he propped
his wounded comrade up against a wall and
took up his rifle instead; then he would pick
up M‘Donough again and stagger cheerily on till
a place of safety was reached.”</p>

<p>At last the gate of the Residency was in sight
of the relieving force, and then the besieged
people looking out saw through the smoke
officers on horseback&mdash;Outram with a great cut
across his face, and one arm in a sling, on a
big white horse, and Havelock walking by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
side (for his horse had been shot), and the
Highlanders in their kilts and for the most
part in their shirt-sleeves, with no coats on.
“Then,” wrote some one who had been all
these weeks in the Residency&mdash;“then all our
doubts and fears were over, and from every pit,
trench, and battery, from behind the sand-bags
piled on shattered houses, from every post still
held by a few gallant spirits, even from the
hospital, rose cheer on cheer.” Sir James
Outram’s horse shied at the gate, but with a
shout the Highlanders hoisted him through; Sir
Henry Havelock followed, “and then in rushed
the eager soldiers, powder-grimed, dusty, and
bloody, ... and all round them as they
swarmed in crowded ... the fighting men of
the garrison, and the civilians whom the siege
had made into soldiers, and women weeping
tears of joy, and the sick and the wounded
who had crawled out of the hospital to welcome
their deliverers. The ladies came down
among the soldiers to shake their hands, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
children hugged them.” “We were all rushing
about,” said a lady, “to give the poor fellows
drinks of water, for they were perfectly exhausted;
and tea was made, of which a large
party of tired, thirsty officers partook without
milk and sugar, and we had nothing to give
them to eat. Every one’s tongue seemed going
at once with so much to ask and to tell, and
the faces of utter strangers beamed on each
other like those of dearest friends and brothers.”
So ended the siege of Lucknow. Sir Henry
Havelock had not been wounded, but he had
suffered much from hard work and from having
so little to eat. “I find it not so easy to
starve at sixty as at forty-seven,” he said one
day. At last, in November, he became very ill,
and when Sir James Outram went to see him
in the common soldier’s tent which he had
always used since he had been in Lucknow, he
told him that he was going to die; “but I have
for forty years so ruled my life that when death
came I might face it without fear,” he added.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
He died on the 24th of November, 1857, and
was buried just outside Lucknow, under a
mango tree, and even now the letter H, which
was carved in the bark&mdash;for no other monument
could be put up to his memory in those days
of war and disturbance&mdash;can just be seen, more
than thirty years afterwards.</p>

<p>Sir James Outram was nursed in Dr. Fayrer’s
house in Lucknow until he was well, and three
years afterwards, in 1860, he left India and came
back to England. Then he had many honours
shown him; but, like Sir Henry Havelock, he
felt the effects of all he had gone through in
India, and gradually he became more ill, and was
at last sent to the south of France, where he
died on the 11th of March, 1863. His body was
brought to England and buried in the Abbey
under the grey stone which you will see in the
nave, and on it were written these words&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR JAMES OUTRAM,<br />
BORN JAN. 29TH, 1805; DIED MAR. 11TH, 1863.<br />
“THE BAYARD OF INDIA.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>I remember, in one of the sermons which he
used to preach to children, Dean Stanley spoke
of this grave of Sir James Outram, and said,
“There was a famous French soldier of bygone
days whose name you will see written in this
Abbey on the gravestone of Sir James Outram,
because in many ways he was like Bayard.
Bayard was a small boy&mdash;only thirteen&mdash;when
he went into his first service, and his mother
told him to remember three things: first, to
fear and love God; secondly, to have gentle
and courteous manners to those above him;
and thirdly, to be generous and charitable,
without pride or haughtiness, to those beneath
him; and these three things he never forgot,
which helped to make him the soldier without
fear and without reproach.” And it was in these
three things that Sir James Outram was supposed
to be so like the French soldier, Bayard.</p>

<p>One more thing I must tell you before we
pass on to David Livingstone. On the morning
of the day when Outram was to be buried, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Highland soldiers came to his house and asked
to be allowed to carry the coffin on their
shoulders down to the Abbey. They were
some men from the 78th Regiment&mdash;the very
same men who had fought under him at the
relief of Lucknow, and who had been with him
when Sir Henry Havelock was buried under
the mango tree; and they came now hoping to
carry the body of Sir James Outram to his
burial. Unfortunately, they were too late, and
were told, much to their disappointment, that
this was impossible because other arrangements
had been made.</p>

<p>We come now to David Livingstone,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the
great traveller and missionary. He was born
in Scotland in 1813. His father and mother
were very poor, and when he was ten years old
he was sent to work in a cotton factory. He
grew up to be a very extraordinary man, as you
will see, and he certainly was a very unusual
boy. He saved up his wages, and the first thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
he bought was a Latin grammar, from which he
used to learn in the evenings after he left
his work; and so interested was he that he
often went on till twelve o’clock at night, when
his mother took away the book and sent him to
bed, for he had to be at the factory at six every
morning. When he grew up he became a
missionary, and went to Africa, where he made
many discoveries, travelling into parts of the
country where no one had ever been before,
and teaching the natives, who were quite
ignorant and wild, but who grew very fond of
this “white man who treated black men as his
brothers”&mdash;for so one native chief described him&mdash;and
who cared for them, and doctored them
when they were ill, and gave up all his life to
them. He had all sorts of adventures. Once
he lived for some time in a place which was full
of lions, who used to come and kill the cattle
even in the day time. The people made up
their minds to try to kill one lion; for if one
of a party of lions is killed, the rest generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
go away. Livingstone went out with them,
and they found the lions on a little hill covered
with trees. Some of the men fired, but did not
hit any of them. Presently Livingstone “saw
one of the beasts sitting on a rock, behind
a little bush”&mdash;these are his own words&mdash;“about
thirty yards off. I took a good aim
at his body through the bush, and fired at
him. The men then called out, ‘He is shot&mdash;he
is shot!’ others cried out, ‘He has been
shot by another man, too; let us go to him.’
I did not see any one else shoot at him,
but I saw the lion’s tail erected in anger
behind the bush, and, turning to the people,
said, ‘Stop a little till I fire again.’ When in
the act of ramming down the bullets I heard
a shout. Starting and looking half round, I
saw the lion in the act of springing on me.
I was upon a little height. He caught my
shoulder as he sprang, and we both came to
the ground together. Growling horribly close
to my ear, he shook me as a terrier dog does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
a rat.” It was wonderful that Livingstone did
not seem to feel any pain or fear; he said he
seemed to be in a kind of dream, but knew quite
well all that was happening. Of course, in
another minute he would have been killed, had
not some of the people fired again at the lion
and this time killed it. But Livingstone never
afterwards could use quite easily the arm which
the lion had crushed. During his travels he
discovered Lake Nyassa, which you can find
marked now on every map of Africa. Before
he went there all that part of the country used
to be marked “unexplored.”</p>

<p>For more than thirty years Livingstone lived
in Africa, always travelling about, and finding
new tribes of natives, all of whom he got to
know, and all of whom became fond of him;
and at last, when he died in a little hut which
his black servants had built for him in the
middle of one of these great African forests,
Susi and Chumah, two of his followers, who had
been with him for many years, came all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
way to England with the body of their dead
master. On the day when he was buried, the
Abbey was crowded with people who came from
all parts of England and Scotland; and among
all the white faces were seen two black ones, for
the faithful servants stood close by the grave;
and Dean Stanley, who read the service, said
afterwards that he had never seen two men
seem more broken-hearted. On his tombstone
you will read of one more thing which he did
for the natives whilst he lived among them;
and that was, to help to abolish the slave-trade
in Central Africa. He was sixty years old
when he died, and he had worked all his life
to raise the lives of thousands of African savages
into something better and happier.</p>

<p>Many other great men I have no time to
tell you about, but there are two more, of
whom I particularly want you to hear a few
words&mdash;Henry Fawcett and Sir John Franklin.
Henry Fawcett<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was not a soldier, nor a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
traveller, but he was known for many years
all over England as the “Blind Postmaster-General.”
He was not born blind, and why
I want to tell you about him is to show you
what a brave man can do when such a terrible
misfortune as becoming blind happens to him.
He was born in 1833, and died in 1884,
and for twenty-six years of his life he was
quite blind. He lost his sight in this way.
He was out shooting one day with his father,
who fired at a bird without noticing that
his son was close by. Suddenly he saw that
some of the shots, instead of hitting the bird,
had hit his son in the eyes. Henry Fawcett
was wearing spectacles, and a shot went
through each of the glasses, making a little
round hole in them, and then going on into
his eyes. From that moment he never saw
again. His first thought, he afterwards told
his sister, was that he should never again see
the lovely view, and the colours of the autumn
leaves on the trees, as he had seen them a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
moment before; his second thought was to try
and do everything he could to comfort his
father, who must need comfort almost as much
as he did himself. So, at twenty-five years of
age, Henry Fawcett, who had made up his mind
to work hard as a barrister&mdash;for he was very
poor&mdash;and make enough money to go into
Parliament, which had been his great wish
ever since he was at school, suddenly found all
his plans and all his hopes upset. But his
courage never gave way; he determined that
his blindness should not make him a helpless,
disappointed man. “In ten minutes after the
accident,” he said some years later, “he had
made up his mind that he would stick to what
he had meant to do.” And so he did. He
had been a great rider, a great skater, and a
great fisherman, and all these things he kept
up. He skated with his friends, holding on to
a stick by which they guided him; he rode, he
fished, he walked, behaving in all things as
though he were not blind. He was obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
give up being a barrister, but he became a
professor at Cambridge. He wrote in papers
and magazines (of course some one had to do
the actual writing for him, but he dictated it),
and at last, when he was thirty-two years old,
that is to say, seven years after the accident,
he achieved his object, and became member of
Parliament (the Blind Member, he was sometimes
called) for Brighton.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell you of all
the work he did for his country after he was
in Parliament, but he was always trying to
improve things; he was never idle, and at
last, when he was made Postmaster-General,
he hardly ever had time for a holiday. He
was a favourite with every one, and, when he
was ill, telegrams and letters used to come
from all parts of England to ask after him.
He always took a great interest in other
blind people, and was fond of saying to
them, “Do what you can to act as though
you were not blind; be of good courage, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
help yourselves.” And to his friends, and all
who had blind friends or relations, he was
never tired of saying, “Do not treat us as
though you pitied us for our misfortune; the
kindest thing that can be done or said to a
blind person is to help him as far as possible
to be of good cheer, to give him confidence
that help will be afforded him whenever
necessary, that there is still good work for
him to do, and, the more active his career, the
more useful his life to others, the more happy
his days to himself.” These are his own
words. They are brave words; but Henry
Fawcett was, as you have seen, a brave man,
and fought and conquered all the great difficulties
with which his blindness surrounded
him, with as much courage as Sir James
Outram showed when he fought his way into
Lucknow, or David Livingstone when he
journeyed through the deserts and forests of
Africa. And that is why a memorial of him
was put up in Westminster Abbey by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
people of England, who subscribed for it, so
that the heroic life of the Blind Postmaster-General
should never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Sir John Franklin<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was a sailor and a great
Arctic explorer, who made many expeditions,
and went nearer to the North Pole than any
man had ever been before. He and his companions
endured every kind of hardship in the
ice and the snow of the Arctic regions. He
died on his third expedition, just two years
after last leaving England, and was buried in
the far-away cold North amidst the snow under
slabs of ice. On the monument in Westminster
Abbey, which was put up in his memory by
his wife, Lady Franklin, are written the words
“O ye frost and cold, O ye ice and snow, bless
ye the Lord: praise Him, and magnify Him
for ever.” The story of the expedition is a
very sad one, for, during the winter after Sir
John’s death, it became clear to the sailors
that the ships were so fast in the ice, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
had closed in and frozen all round them, that
they would never be able to move again. So
at last, nearly all the provisions being exhausted,
the men abandoned their ships, and
with boats and sledges, which they carried
or dragged over the ice, set out to walk southwards
in the hope that they might at last reach
the unfrozen sea and meet a ship. But this
they never did, for they were starved and ill,
and although another expedition had been sent
from England to look for them, it was too late
to save them. The only traces ever found of
them were their skeletons, and the boats and
sledges, containing many books and papers
which Sir John had written, saying how far he
had been, and what he had done on this voyage
from which he never returned.</p>

<p>His epitaph, written by Lord Tennyson, is
one of the most beautiful in the Abbey&mdash;</p>

<p>
“Not here! the white North has thy bones; and thou,<br />
<span class="indent1">Heroic sailor-soul,</span><br />
Art passing on thine happier voyage now<br />
<span class="indent1">Toward no earthly pole.”</span><br />

</div>


<p>In Westminster Abbey are the graves of many
poets&mdash;so many that one part of the church (the
south transept) is always known as Poets’ Corner.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Chaucer,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who wrote among other
things a book called the “Canterbury Tales,”
and who died as long ago as 1400, was one of the
first English poets buried in Poets’ Corner; and
the last was Alfred Tennyson,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> who died in 1892,
and was buried close beside Chaucer, just four
hundred and ninety-two years afterwards.</p>

<p>When I was telling you the story of the
Indian Mutiny, I spoke of a poem called “Lucknow,”
which described in a wonderful way
the sufferings of the people who were shut
up in the Residency during the long siege.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
This poem and very many others were written
by Alfred Tennyson, the great poet, who was
made by the Queen Poet Laureate of England,
and then, many years afterwards, Lord Tennyson,
by which name you will always hear him
spoken of.</p>

<p>There is a story told of how the first verses
Alfred Tennyson ever made were written. His
father was a clergyman, and Alfred and his
brothers and sisters lived all their lives in the
country, running wild in the woods and the
fields, and learning all about birds and flowers,
until they were old enough to go to school.
One Sunday morning, when every one but
Alfred, who was then very small, was going to
church, his elder brother Charles said he would
give him something to do, and told him he
must write some verses about the flowers in the
garden. When they came in, Alfred appeared
with his slate covered all over with his first
poem. He was very fond of story-telling, and
he and his brothers and sisters would combine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to make up long and exciting tales which sometimes
lasted for months. When he went to
school he began to read a great deal, especially
poetry. If he found any he particularly liked,
he would try to imitate it in poems of his own,
and in this way he and his brother Charles,
who was with him at school, used to spend a
great deal of their spare time.</p>

<p>It would take too long, and it would not
be interesting, to tell you the names of even
the chief poems which Lord Tennyson wrote.
By-and-by you will read many of them for yourselves,
and two I am sure you will specially
enjoy. One is the “Siege of Lucknow,” which
we have so often spoken of; and the other is
the “Revenge,” which is also a story of fighting&mdash;but
a sea-fight in the time of Queen Elizabeth.
Lord Tennyson, like most poets, was more fond
of the country than of towns, and most of his
life he lived either in the Isle of Wight or in
Surrey. He used, until quite the end of his life,
to enjoy taking long country walks, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
never lost his love for flowers or birds, or failed
to notice them; and this in spite of having all
his life been very short-sighted. It was said of
him that “when he was looking at any object
he seemed to be smelling it,” so closely used he
to hold it to his eyes.</p>

<p>And yet, with this difficulty, he noticed “more
than most men with perfect sight would see.
I remember his telling me,” so wrote a friend of
his, “<i>if you tread on daisies they turn up
underfoot and get rosy</i>. His hearing, on the
other hand, was exceptionally keen, and he held
it as a sort of compensation for his blurred
sight; he could hear <i>the shriek of a bat</i>, which
he always said was the test of a quick ear.”</p>

<p>Lord Tennyson was eighty-three when he
died, and when he was buried in Westminster
Abbey the great church was crowded, not only
during the funeral service, but for many days
and even weeks afterwards, by hundreds of
people, who came to see, and lay flowers on, his
grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Although so many poets were buried in the
Abbey, yet there were many others who when
they died were buried in the country, or in
other churches in London, and, when this was the
case, monuments were often put up in the Abbey
in memory of them. For instance, Shakespeare,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
the greatest of all our great poets, was buried at
Stratford-on-Avon, where he had lived for the
last part of his life, and where he died.</p>

<p>There is not a very great deal known about
his life. He was the son of a country shopkeeper,
who was very poor, but who managed
to send his son to the grammar school at
Stratford-on-Avon, where they lived. When he
was fourteen he was taken away from school,
and had to earn his own living. It is sometimes
said that he was first a butcher’s boy,
and had to carry out the meat, but no one
knows exactly what he did after he left school
until he was about nineteen. Then he went
to London, and began to write poetry and plays.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
He had at this time hardly any money, and was
thankful to earn a penny whenever he could
by holding horses, or making himself useful in
any way he could think of, and was nicknamed
by his friends “Jack-of-all-trades.” At last he
got employment as a writer of plays for the
Globe Theatre. This Globe Theatre was very
different from the theatres of nowadays. It
was a round wooden building with no roof,
except just over the stage, and there it was
covered in to protect the dresses of the actors
and actresses in case of bad weather. Gradually
it became clear that this William Shakespeare,
who had come to London quite a poor and
unknown man, was a great poet, his plays
began to be talked of, and many great and rich
men became his friends. In a few years he
was no longer poor, and had begun to save
money to buy himself a house at Stratford-on-Avon,
where he had been born. To do
this had always been a dream of his: for a long
time his wife and children had been living there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
while he worked hard for them in London, and
when at last he had bought his house, which
was called New Place, he left London and went
home to them.</p>

<p>Many years passed away, and Shakespeare,
who had written great plays such as <i>Hamlet</i>
and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, which you will
all know and perhaps see acted some day, lived
quietly in the little town of Stratford-on-Avon,
making friends of all the people round him,
both rich and poor, and seeing his own plays
acted in a great empty barn near his house, for
in those days there was no theatre in Stratford.</p>

<p>“Master Shakespeare,” as he was called, was
buried in the churchyard of the little town
he had been so fond of all his life; and many
years afterwards, when his name had become
known all over England, and his plays and
his poems had become famous as they had
never been during his lifetime, a monument was
put up to his memory in Westminster Abbey
close by the graves of two other poets, Spenser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and Drayton, who had been his friends: on
it are written these words out of his own play
of <i>The Tempest</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="indent1">“The Cloud-capt Towers,</span><br />
<span class="indent1">The Gorgeous Palaces,</span><br />
<span class="indent1">The Solemn Temples,</span><br />
<span class="indent1">The Great Globe itself,</span><br />
<span class="indent1">Yea, all which it inherit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Shall dissolve;</span><br />
And, like the baseless fabric of a vision,<br />
<span class="indent1">Leave not a wreck behind.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Among all the poets who are buried in the
south transept, there is one great musician,
George Frederick Handel.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Dean Stanley says
that “Handel, who composed the music of the
‘Messiah’ and the ‘Israel in Egypt,’ must have
been a poet no less than a musician, and therefore
he was not unfitly buried in Poets’ Corner.”</p>

<p>Handel was the son of a German doctor, and
was born in a little German town. As a boy
he was very fond of music, but as his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
meant him to be a lawyer, he would not let
him hear any for fear that he would want to
be a musician. Once,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> when George was seven
years old, his father went to visit another son
who lived at the court of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels.
The little boy, who had most
likely heard his brother speak of the court
concerts, begged to go too, but of course he was
told that it was impossible. His father drove
off, but still George determined to go. He
managed to slip out, and ran as long as he could
after the carriage. At last he was seen and
taken in, and as there was no time to bring
him home, he went with his father to the
court. He soon made friends among the duke’s
musicians, who let him try the organ. One
day after the service he was lifted on to the
organ-stool, and played so wonderfully that the
duke, who was in church, asked who it was.
When he heard that it was the little seven-year-old
Handel, he sent for his father, and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
him that his son would one day be such a great
musician that it would be quite wrong to make
him a lawyer. So from that day George was
regularly taught music. When he was older he
came to England, and here he lived most of his
life, and here he wrote most of the music which
is known almost all over the world. He used
to give concerts at the English court, to which
the Prince of Wales, the son of George II., and
the princess, and many great people came.
Sometimes at these concerts ladies would talk
instead of listening to the music, and then
Handel quite lost his temper. “His rage was
uncontrollable,” so we are told, “and sometimes
carried him to the length of swearing and
calling names; whereupon the gentle princess
would say to the offenders, ‘Hush, hush! Handel
is angry;’ and when all was quiet the concert
would go on again.” Handel, when he was old,
became quite blind, but he still played the
organ up to the very end of his life. He died
on Good Friday, April 13, 1759, and was buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in the Abbey, and on his monument are written
the words, “I know that my Redeemer liveth,”
from the Book of Job, which he had set to most
beautiful music, and had asked to have written
upon his tomb.</p>

<p>I have only spoken to you of Geoffrey
Chaucer and of Alfred Tennyson, the first and
the last poets who were buried in the Abbey;
of Shakespeare, the greatest of all English poets,
and of George Frederick Handel, the musician;
but very many others are remembered in Poets’
Corner. And when you some day walk round
the Abbey you will see there the graves or
monuments of most of the great English writers.</p>

<p>The north transept is full of the graves and
monuments of statesmen. A great many of
them you must have heard of, and some of you
perhaps belong to the Primrose League, which
was founded in 1881 in memory of Benjamin
Disraeli,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Lord Beaconsfield, whose monument is
in the Abbey. He was twice Prime Minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of England, and when he died the Primrose
League (the badge of which is a primrose, and
which was chosen because it was said to be
his favourite flower) was started to band people
together to carry on the work and help on the
political party to which he had belonged.
Then there are monuments to three members
of one family&mdash;the family of Canning&mdash;who
were all great statesmen. George Canning,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
who was born as long ago as 1770, became
known as a wonderful orator. When he was
quite a small boy at school he used to say that he
meant some day to be a member of Parliament,
and at Eton he helped to start a debating society
which was modelled on the House of Commons.
Here his speeches soon became famous among
the boys. He lived to be not only a member
of Parliament, but Prime Minister of England.
His youngest son Charles,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> who was also a great
man, became Earl Canning and first Viceroy of
India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“The third great Canning” was Stratford
Canning<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (a cousin of Charles), who has been
called “the greatest ambassador of our time,”
and who before he died was made Lord Stratford
de Redcliffe, by which name he is best known.
Each of these three great men gave all his
time and all his strength to work for the good
of his country. Two of them, George Canning
and his son, the Viceroy of India, are buried
in one grave here in the Abbey. Lord Stratford
de Redcliffe, although his statue stands side by
side with the monuments to his uncle and
cousin, is buried in the little country churchyard
of Frant, in Kent.</p>

<p>Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was an old man
of ninety-three when he died. He had done so
much, and known so many great and interesting
people, that the story of his life is a book you
will all like to read some day. One of the first
things he remembered was how, when he was
a little boy at school, he had seen Lord Nelson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
It was at Eton, and Nelson, “with all his
wounds and all his honours”&mdash;for so Lord
Stratford describes him&mdash;came down to see the
boys, and asked that they might have a whole
holiday. More than eighty years afterwards,
when Lord Stratford de Redcliffe died, there
was found in his room a little picture of Lord
Nelson, which he had kept ever since those far-off
school days.</p>

<p>I remember Dean Stanley telling us that
when Lord Stratford de Redcliffe was a very
old man he remembered quite clearly what he
had learnt and done when he was a little child
at home. “Not long ago,” the Dean said, “I
was visiting this aged and famous statesman, and
he repeated to me, word for word, the Evening
Hymn beginning ‘Glory to Thee, my God, this
night,’ as he had learnt it, he told me, from his
nurse ninety years before.”</p>

<p>I must not end this chapter without telling
you the names of three more great statesmen.
You will often hear the two Pitts and William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Wilberforce spoken of, and I should like to say
a few words about all three before beginning
the stories of the kings and queens.</p>

<p>William Pitt<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> was Prime Minister of England,
and was made Lord Chatham by King George
III. He and his son, the younger William Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
are as well known to all Englishmen as George
Canning and his son Earl Canning, about whom
I have told you. Lord Chatham was, like
George Canning, a great orator, and even when
he was very old and very ill, he would come
down to the Houses of Parliament and make
wonderful speeches, which sometimes lasted as
long as three hours and a half, but which were
so interesting that they were listened to in
perfect silence; “the stillness,” it is said, “was
so deep that the dropping of a handkerchief
would have been heard.” When he died he
was buried in the Abbey; and in the same
grave, twenty-eight years afterwards, was buried
his son William, the second Pitt, who was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
even greater statesman than his father. This
William was, when quite a little boy, astonishingly
clever. “The fineness of William’s mind,”
wrote his mother, in the old-fashioned words of
those times, “makes him enjoy with the greatest
pleasure what would be above the reach of any
other creature of his small age.” He was too
delicate to be sent to school, but he was made
to work hard at home till he was old enough to
be sent to Cambridge. Although a very young
man when he became a member of Parliament,
his first speech in the House was a great
success. “It is not a chip of the old block,” said
some one who heard him&mdash;“it is the old block
himself;” meaning that this speech of young
William Pitt was as good as any his father
had made. When he first became Prime Minister
he was only just twenty-four years old, and from
that time until he died (twenty-four years afterwards)
he was one of the most illustrious
men in Europe. He and Wilberforce,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of the statesmen about whom I must tell
you, were both very much interested in one
thing&mdash;and this was the abolition of (or doing
away with) slavery. The name of Wilberforce
will never be forgotten, for he it was who
first thought and said that slavery ought to
be put an end to, all over the world, wherever
Englishmen were the rulers. Wilberforce
and William Pitt were once staying together
in a country house not far from London, and
sitting together one day under an old tree
in the park, they began to talk about slavery,
and to say how terrible a thing it was that
the lives of hundreds and thousands of men
and women and children were made full of
misery by cruel masters who worked their
slaves far harder than they worked their horses
or their oxen. “I well remember,” wrote
Mr. Wilberforce in his Diary, “after this conversation
with Mr. Pitt I resolved to give notice
in the House of Commons of my intention to
bring forward the abolition of the slave-trade.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
And not long afterwards Wilberforce made a
great speech in the House of Commons about
slavery, and in the end a law was passed to
do away with the slave-trade. Wherever the
English flag was flying there should be no
slavery, and a slave who could once set foot on
any land held by Englishmen became a free man.</p>

<p>When Pitt died Wilberforce was one of those
who carried a banner in the great funeral procession,
when he was buried, as I have told you,
in the same grave with his father, the first Pitt.
Many years afterwards Wilberforce too “was
buried there amongst his friends,” and in
another part of the Abbey there is a large
statue of him, as an old and bent man, sitting
in an armchair. When you go round the
Abbey you must look for this monument, for it
is said to be very like him during the last part
of his life.</p>

<p>But we can spend no more time now in
telling stories of statesmen, and must in the
next chapter go on to the kings and queens.</p>

<p>We now come to the kings and queens who are
buried in Westminster Abbey, and this will be
the last chapter of my book.</p>

<p>You remember my telling you how Henry III.
built a new shrine for Edward the Confessor.
Three years after this Chapel of Edward the
Confessor (as it is called) was finished, King
Henry III.,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who had reigned for fifty-six years,
died, and was buried in the Abbey which he
had loved so long. His son Edward, who now
became Edward I., was just starting home from
the Holy Land with his wife, Queen Eleanor,
who always went with him on all his journeys,
when his father died, and he brought with him
from the East the marble for the tomb.</p>

<p>I expect you will all remember having heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of this Queen Eleanor, the wife of Edward I.
She was so brave and so fond of him that she
would go with him when he went on his crusade
to the Holy Land; and when people told her
that it was dangerous, and that she might be
killed, and tried to persuade her to stay at home,
her only answer was, “The way to heaven is as
near from Palestine as from England.”</p>

<p>She was not killed, or even hurt; but there
is a story told of how, while they were in the
Holy Land, Edward was wounded by one of his
enemies, who stabbed him in the arm with a
poisoned dagger. This would certainly have
killed him, if Eleanor had not at once sucked the
poison out of the wound, and so saved his life.</p>

<p>Edward I.&mdash;Edward Longshanks, as he was
called, for he was more than six feet high&mdash;and
Queen Eleanor were crowned King and
Queen of England in Westminster Abbey when
they came back from the Holy Land. After
the coronation a great banquet was given, to
which Edward and his brother Edmund and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
their nobles and attendants came&mdash;five hundred
of them, riding on five hundred magnificent
horses. When they dismounted, the horses were
let loose in the crowd, and anybody who succeeded
in catching one was allowed to keep it.</p>

<p>When, after having been Queen of England
eighteen years, Eleanor<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> died at Hardby, in
Nottinghamshire, her body was brought to
Westminster, to be buried in the Abbey. From
Nottinghamshire to London was a long journey
in those days, and it had to be done by
stages. Wherever the funeral procession stopped,
Edward ordered a cross to be put up in memory
of the queen. They were called the “Eleanor
Crosses,” and there were altogether twelve of
them. The last was in London, at Charing
Cross, which was the final halting-place before
the procession reached the Abbey.</p>

<p>Edward I. was a great soldier, and gradually
he “filled the Confessor’s Chapel with trophies
of war.” One of these trophies you must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
specially notice when you go over the Abbey.
At the west end of the Confessor’s Chapel stand
two chairs. One is a plain, very old-looking
wooden chair, much scratched and battered, and
underneath it is a rough-looking bit of stone.
This old stone is called the “Stone of Scone,”
and on it all the Kings of Scotland had been
crowned at Scone, which was the capital of
Scotland up to the time when Edward I.
became King of England. Edward I. and
Alexander III., King of Scotland, were always
at war; and when the English at last conquered
the Scotch, Edward took away this ancient
treasure, the “Stone of Scone,” and brought it
to Westminster Abbey, that our kings might be
crowned upon it, as Kings of England and Scotland.
The wooden chair was made by his orders,
and the stone put underneath it, and there it has
been ever since, for nearly six hundred years.</p>

<p>The other chair was made long afterwards
for the coronation of William III. and Mary.
Between the two are the sword and shield of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Edward III., which he is said to have used in
all his many wars against France. The sword
is seven feet long, and weighs eighteen pounds.</p>

<p>Edward I.,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> “the greatest of the Plantagenets,”
was buried close by Queen Eleanor, but his tomb
is quite plain. There is no figure on it, and no
carving, as there is on the tombs of the other
kings and queens. Dean Stanley explained,
when he showed us the Abbey as children,
that, for many years after Edward I. died,
there was a kind of belief that, although
the king was dead, yet, if another war broke
out with Scotland, he would once again lead his
army against the enemy, as he had so often done
before. And so from time to time they would
come and lift off the great marble slab which
covered his tomb, and which was easily moved,
and look in to see if the king was still there.</p>

<p>The first of our kings who was crowned on
the “Stone of Scone” was Edward I.’s son,
Edward II. He was crowned in the Abbey, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
was not buried there. The next king who was
buried there was Edward III.,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> whose sword
and shield we saw just now.</p>

<p>Richard II.,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the grandson of Edward III.,
is sometimes called the “Westminster King,”
because he was crowned and married and buried
in the Abbey.</p>

<p>He was only eleven years old when he became
King of England. For a week before his coronation
he had lived in the Tower of London,
which was the custom in those days for all
kings and queens before they were crowned. The
procession from the Tower to the Abbey was one
of the most splendid that had ever been seen.
But the service was very long, and the sermon
was longer, and before it was over the king was
carried out fainting. After this there was a
great banquet, at which he had to appear again,
and then at last the long day was over.</p>

<p>Five years later he was married in the Abbey
to Queen Anne. After reigning for twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
years, he was deposed by Henry of Lancaster,
and murdered at Pontefract Castle in Yorkshire
by his enemies&mdash;for he had made many during
his life. He was buried in Hertfordshire. When
Henry V. came to the throne, he ordered that
Richard’s body should be brought to Westminster,
and then at last it was laid in the
same tomb in which, many years before, his
wife, Queen Anne, had been buried. Henry V.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
when he was a boy was so wild that he was
called “Madcap Harry.” But he was particularly
fond of the Abbey, and although most
of his reign was spent in fighting with France,
he did a great deal to improve and decorate
his great church, and when the English won
the battle of Agincourt (of which you may
have heard or read), his first thought was to
order a Thanksgiving Service to be held at
Westminster. He had always said he wished
to be buried in the Abbey; so, when he died in
France his body was brought to England. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
long procession from Paris to Calais, and from
Dover to London, was headed by the King of
Scots, James I.... As it approached London
it was met by all the clergy. The services were
held first at St. Paul’s, and then at the Abbey.
No English king’s funeral had ever been so
grand. His three chargers were led up to the
altar, behind the effigy (a wax model of the king
carried outside his coffin), which lay on a
splendid car, accompanied by torches and white-robed
priests innumerable, ... and at the extreme
eastern end of the Confessor’s Chapel
was deposited the body of the most splendid
king that England had to that time produced.”</p>

<p>Above his tomb, on a bar which stretches
across the steps leading out of the chapel, are
hung his helmet and saddle. The helmet is
probably the very one which he wore at the
battle of Agincourt, and which twice saved
his life on that day; it is much dinted, and
shows the marks of many sword-cuts.</p>

<p>Henry VI. was crowned king when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
only nine years old, and on the day of his coronation
it is said that he “sat on the platform in
the Abbey beholding all the people about sadly
and wisely.” But as he was so young the
service was shortened and he had much less to
endure than the last boy-king, Richard II.</p>

<p>There is a story told of how, toward the end
of his reign, King Henry VI. used to come and
wander about in the Abbey between seven
and eight o’clock in the evening, when it was
growing dusk. He generally came quite alone,
and only the abbot who carried a torch went
with him round the dark and silent church.
One night he went into the Confessor’s Chapel,
where he spent more than an hour, wondering
if room could be, by-and-by, made for his own
tomb. “It was suggested to him that the
tomb of Henry V. should be pushed a little on
one side, and his own placed beside it; but he
replied, ‘Nay, let him alone; he lieth like a
noble prince; I would not trouble him.’ But
close beside the shrine of the Confessor there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
seemed to be room for another tomb. ‘Lend me
your staff,’ he said to Lord Cromwell, who was
with him that evening; ‘is it not fitting I
should have a place here, where my father and
my ancestors lie, near St. Edward?’ And then,
pointing with a white staff to the place indicated,
he said, ‘Here, methinks, is a convenient place;’
adding, ‘Forsooth, forsooth, here will we lie;
here is a good place for us.’” Three days afterwards
the tomb was ordered to be made; but
it was never even begun, for Henry was deposed
by Edward IV. and died in the Tower, and from
there his body was taken and buried in the
Abbey of Chertsey.</p>

<p>Close by all these great kings and queens
are several tombs of children. Among them is
a monument to a little deaf and dumb girl of
five years old, the Princess Catherine, daughter
of Henry III. “Close to her, as if to keep her
company, are buried her two little brothers, and
four little nephews.”</p>

<p>So far I have told you principally of kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
who are buried in Westminster Abbey, but now
we come to the tombs of some of the Queens of
England.</p>

<p>You remember that Henry VII. had built a
great and magnificent chapel which was called
after him. The first queen buried there was
his wife, Queen Elizabeth, who was the mother
of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>She had had a life full of adventures. She
was the daughter of Edward IV., and sister of
the two poor little princes who were murdered
in the Tower by their uncle Richard.</p>

<p>Princess Elizabeth was born in Westminster,
and christened in the Abbey, but she lived
afterwards in the country at the palace of
Sheen. When she was four years old, her father,
Edward IV., was defeated in battle, and King
Henry VI. was made King of England in his
stead. The queen, the Princess Elizabeth, and
her two baby sisters had to leave Sheen and
come back to Westminster, where they were
hidden in a place of safety while all these wars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
(the Wars of the Roses, as they were called)
were going on. After two years, however, her
father was victorious. Henry was deposed, and
Edward IV. was once more King of England.
To celebrate the victory, a great ball was given
at Windsor Castle, and the little six-year-old
princess, who was a special pet of her father’s,
came down and danced first with him, and then
with some of the great nobles. When she was
nine years old, her father and Louis XI., the
King of France, decided that, as soon as she
was grown up, she should marry the Dauphin,
his eldest son, who, if he lived, would in time
become the King of France. Then began a busy
time for the little princess who might one day
be Queen of France. Besides all her English
lessons, she had to learn to speak and write
French and Spanish, and she was always called
“Madame la Dauphine,” even while she was a
little girl in the schoolroom. At last she was
old enough to be married, but when the time
for the wedding came, the King of France said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
he had found another wife for his son. Edward
IV., who had set his heart on seeing his
favourite daughter the Queen of France, was so
disappointed and angry that he became very
ill, and died. Then it was that Elizabeth’s little
brother Edward became Edward V., and the day
was fixed for his coronation in the Abbey. A
great banquet was arranged, and all the guests
were invited; but before the day came, the
little king and his younger brother, the Duke
of York, were both killed by the order of their
uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who then
made himself King Richard III. of England.
Now began a sad time for Princess Elizabeth,
who was first taken away from her mother and
sisters, and afterwards kept a prisoner in a
lonely old castle in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the time she was shut up
here, many things had been going on about
which she probably knew nothing.</p>

<p>Richard III. was hated by every one, and two
years after he had become king, Henry, Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
Richmond, one of the greatest nobles in England,
decided to try and depose him, and set free
Princess Elizabeth. So he got together an army
and marched to Leicester, where the king was
then living. On the evening of a summer day
the two armies camped at a place called Bosworth
Field, and there the next day a great
battle, the Battle of Bosworth, was fought,
and Richard III. was killed. It is said that the
crown of England had, at the beginning of the
battle, been hidden in a hawthorn bush, and
when afterwards it was found by a soldier, the
Earl of Richmond was at once crowned King
Henry VII., and all the soldiers who had been
lying down, resting after the long fight, stood up
round him and sang the <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>

<p>When Princess Elizabeth, in her far-away
lonely castle, heard cries of joy from the people
who came crowding to the doors of her prison she
guessed that something had happened and that
a better time might be coming for her. And soon
came a messenger from the king, who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
sent straight from the field of battle, with orders
to set the princess free and bring her to London.</p>

<p>The end of this story is really almost like the
end of a fairy tale, for her many troubles were
now over, and the next year she married Henry
VII., and so became Queen of England. And
when after many years she died, she was buried&mdash;as
I told you at the beginning of this story&mdash;in
the Chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster
Abbey. Some years later the king was buried
beside her; and inside the bronze railings surrounding
the tomb (which stands behind the
altar) you will see the figures of Henry VII.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, lying side by side.</p>

<p>Three other queens who are buried here are
known to all of you. Two of them were
sisters, Queen Mary<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and Queen Elizabeth,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the
daughters of Henry VIII.; and the third was
their cousin, another Mary&mdash;Mary Queen of
Scots,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> who was beheaded by the order of Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Elizabeth, because she was afraid that Mary
wanted to make herself Queen of England in
her stead. Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth,
though they were sisters, had all their lives been
enemies. They differed about everything, but
especially about their religion, for Mary had been
brought up a Roman Catholic, and Elizabeth
and their little brother Edward (who afterwards
became Edward VI.) were Protestants. Elizabeth
and Edward were very fond of one another, and
it is said that Elizabeth used to spend a great
deal of her time when she was quite a little girl
in doing needlework for her brother. On his
second birthday she gave him for a birthday present
a little shirt which she had made for him all
herself, though she was then only six years old.</p>

<p>Both these queens, when little girls, were
made to do a great many lessons, and were
taught Latin and Greek with their brother, as
well as French and Italian and Spanish. Queen
Mary was always very fond of music, and there
is a story told of how, when she was only three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
years old, some friends of her father’s (King
Henry VIII.) came down to see her at Richmond,
where she was then living. The little
princess&mdash;for this was a long time before she
became queen&mdash;was not in the least shy: she
welcomed her visitors, and after talking to them
“and entertaining them with most goodly
countenance”&mdash;for so one of the gentlemen who
was there wrote about her afterwards&mdash;she
played to them on the virginal (a kind of
piano), after which strawberries and biscuits and
wine were brought in, and the baby princess had
nothing more to do but enjoy herself. These
three children, Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward,
became in turn Queens and King of England.</p>

<p>When Henry VIII. died, Edward, the youngest
of the three, became King Edward VI. But he
had all his life been very delicate, and when
he had been king just six years, and was
sixteen years old, he died, and then Mary, his
eldest sister, became queen. The reign of Queen
Mary&mdash;Bloody Mary she is sometimes called&mdash;was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
a terrible time in England, for, as I told
you, she was a Roman Catholic, and so determined
was she that all English men and women
should be Roman Catholics too, that she ordered
those who were Protestants to change their
religion and become Catholics; and if they
refused, they were burnt alive. Hundreds of
people were killed in this cruel way; and Queen
Mary became at last so much hated, that when
she died, and the Princess Elizabeth became
queen, there was rejoicing almost all over
England. For in spite of all the queen had
done to make England a Roman Catholic
country, by far the greater part of the people
had remained Protestants, and now once again
had a Protestant queen to reign over them.</p>

<p>Almost the last time a Catholic Mass (or
service) was held in Westminster Abbey was at
the funeral of Queen Mary.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The procession, led
by the monks, who knew that this was most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
likely the last service in which they would
ever take part, came from St. James’s Palace,
where she died, down to Westminster, and at the
great West Door of the Abbey were waiting four
bishops and the Abbot of Westminster in all the
magnificent robes which Catholic priests wear.</p>

<p>The body of the queen was carried into Henry
VII.’s chapel, and all night the Abbey was dimly
lighted by the hundred wax torches which were
held and kept alight by the soldiers of the
Queen’s Guard. The next day she was buried,
and the Catholic Bishop of Winchester preached
before Elizabeth, who, although she hated the
religion, did not refuse to come to the funeral of
her sister, as Queen Mary had done years before
on the death of their brother Edward, when,
rather than come to a Protestant service in the
Abbey, she ordered a separate funeral mass to
be said before her in the Tower.</p>

<p>A little more than a month after this, Queen
Elizabeth was crowned in the Abbey, and for
the next forty-five years “good Queen Bess,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
as she is often called, reigned over England, and
did much that was wise and good. One thing
she did, however, that was neither wise nor good,
and that one thing I spoke about when I told
you that two Queen Marys were buried here,
one of whom was Mary Queen of Scots, the
cousin of Elizabeth. The story of Mary Queen
of Scots is a long and very sad one. You will
some day read about her, if you have not already
done so, and when you hear how she was imprisoned
in Fotheringay Castle, and at last beheaded,
you will perhaps feel that in some ways
Elizabeth could be as cruel as her sister Mary.</p>

<p>These three queens are all buried in Henry
VII.’s Chapel&mdash;Elizabeth and Mary together in
a white marble tomb, on the outside of which
lies the statue of Queen Elizabeth, and on which
these words in Latin were written by James I.:
“Consorts both in throne and grave, here rest we
two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, in hope of our
resurrection.” And not far from them lies Mary
Queen of Scots. After she had been beheaded
at Fotheringay Castle her body was buried in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Peterborough Cathedral, and from there it was
brought to Westminster by her son, James VI.
of Scotland, who was also James I. of England,
“that the like honour,” so he wrote, “might be
done to his dearest mother” as had been done to
Queen Elizabeth and the other Queen Mary.</p>

<p>We are now coming to the end of these stories,
and I must only mention in a very few words some
of the other graves in this chapel of Henry VII.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who, after Charles I. had
been beheaded, made himself Protector of England,
was buried here among the kings and
queens. It is said that his funeral was more
magnificent than any king’s had ever been, and
that an immense sum of money was spent upon
it. Close by him was buried Elizabeth Claypole,
his favourite daughter, and many of his soldiers
and followers.</p>

<p>Three years afterwards his body was dug up
and taken to Tyburn. There his head was cut
off, on the 30th of January, the anniversary of
the day Charles I. had been beheaded, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
which his body was buried under the gallows,
instead of in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>“Here are also buried,” says Dean Stanley,
“some of our young princes and princesses.
There was that wonderfully gifted boy, Edward
VI.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> (of whom we have already spoken), “who
was only sixteen when he died, and who before
that time had by his diligence and his honesty
made himself beloved and trusted by all about
him. There is the good Prince Henry, eldest
son of James I., who when his foolish attendants
provoked him to swear because a butcher’s dog
had killed a stag that he was hunting, said,
‘Away with you! All the pleasure in the world
is not worth a profane oath.’ Then there was,
again, that other Henry, Duke of Gloucester,
who sat on the knees of his father, Charles I.,
on the day before his execution, and who when
his father said to him, ‘They will try to make
you king instead of your elder brother,’ fired up
like a little man, and said, ‘I will be torn in
pieces first!’ Then there are two small tombs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of the two infant daughters of James I. (one of
which is made in the shape of a cradle). And
to these tombs of these two little girls were
brought, in after-days, by King Charles II., the
bones of the two young murdered princes
(Edward V. and Richard, Duke of York), which
in his time were discovered at the foot of the
staircase in the Tower. Well might all these
princes be mourned and have a place in this
Abbey, because many of them, though they died
early, showed of what stuff they were made, and
that they would have been fit to be kings and
to be with kings.”</p>

<p>As I copied down these words of Dean
Stanley’s, I was once more reminded of him, and
once more I seemed to hear him telling the
children gathered round him in the Abbey some
of these stories which I have just been telling
you. And as the last words in this book about
the Abbey are his words, so the last grave which
I want to tell you of is his, and when you some
day go to the Abbey you must not forget to
see (also in Henry VII.’s Chapel) the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
where, together in one tomb, are buried Arthur
Stanley,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Dean of Westminster, and his wife,
Lady Augusta.</p>

<p>Dean Stanley knew more about Westminster
Abbey than almost any other man; and not only
did he <i>know</i> more, but by writing books and
by telling stories to his friends as he showed
them over the great church, he helped many
other people, who but for him perhaps would
not have thought much about the Abbey at all
to know something of the Church of St. Peter
on Thorney Isle.</p>

<p>And it is because I hoped that what interested
us as children many years ago might interest
others now, that I have tried to remember, and
collect, and write down these tales from Westminster
Abbey in something the same way as
they were told to us by the Dean.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
